11.10.1 Exercise:
'''
# Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It
# doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check
# whether a string is in the dictionary.
# 
# If you did Exercise 10, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the list in
# operator and the bisection search.
